1. Where are we now? Challenges for the new era? 
2. How to sustain exponential growth? 
3. Future promising&challenging directions?

- __Epoch 1__ , Interested in Connecting People
- __Epoch 2__, Computers to Computers
- __Epoch 3__, Services to Services 
- __Epoch 4__, People to People
- __Epoch 5__, People to Insights based on Machine Learning

## Network Balance

Unbalanced Distributed Systems Infrastructure -
- _limiting value_ due to scarce resource
- _increase cost_ due to idle resource

## Logically Centralized State - Simpler & Efficient
- In a __Distributed System__, to exchange state, needs `O(n log n)` Communication & `O(log n)` Convergance
- In a __Centralized System__, `O(n)` Communication & `O(1)` Convergence

- __Epoch 1__ , Interested in Connecting People
- __Epoch 2__, Computers to Computers
- __Epoch 3__, Services to Services 
- __Epoch 4__, People to People
- __Epoch 5__, People to Insights based on Machine Learning

## Network Balance

Unbalanced Distributed Systems Infrastructure -
- _limiting value_ due to scarce resource
- _increase cost_ due to idle resource

## Logically Centralized State - Simpler & Efficient
- In a __Distributed System__, to exchange state, needs `O(n log n)` Communication & `O(log n)` Convergance
- In a __Centralized System__, `O(n)` Communication & `O(1)` Convergence


## Better Distributed System - How ?

- Network can really make a huge difference in Distributed Systems
- _Performance improvement on Processor has slowed down since 2015_
- Single General Purpose Server Architecture is not optimal for all kind of applications
- Domain & Application Specific Accelrators like __GPU, TPU__ will become the most obvious choice
- Large individual hardwares like GPU, CPU will move to a fixed cost model 

## Trends

### Scaling out efficient:

Tightly-Coupled Distributed Systems may be preferred compared to Loose Coupling.
With _Loosely-coupled Distributed System_ it was easy to scale out applications from 1 Server to 10 of thousands of Server but we are not neceesarliy 
Highly Efficient, this leads extracting lesser benefits from individual server from generation to generation.
In Tight Coupling, we will focus on extracting more benefits from individual server, which may lead flatten curve much earlier.


### Matching Application Balance to Virtual Cluster Composition - Software Defined Infrastructure

Able to extract the Balance Point of a particular Distributed System & being able to carve out an isolated subset of you _compute, communication, Accelerator & Storage Infrastructure_ to match the __Balance Point__

### Developer Productivity
